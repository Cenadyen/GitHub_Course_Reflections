When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want a remote repository in case you need to leave anywhere, but you still need to work on code. Additionally, it would be handy to be able to take the code and be able to show it to people without having to lug around the local machine that has all your work.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes things in the remote repository might be experimental changes that are not necessarily meant for the full project. In case something is drastically changed about the remote repository, it is a good idea to be able to go back to the project with a pull rather than having to try and "fix" what went wrong with the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is simply a different section of commits within a single repository. 
	Clones are entire repositories that are copied directly into a local machine.
	Forks are entire repositories that are cloned to a different repository that points to the original owner.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
